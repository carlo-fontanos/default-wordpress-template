* ALWAYS start a new branch before making changes to the codes

* Use a git client, preferably Source Tree or you can use git commands from your terminal, your choice!
* Many smaller commits are better than one large commit. Edit your file(s), if the edit does not break the code with things like syntax errors, commit. It is easier to reconcile many smaller commits than one large commit.
